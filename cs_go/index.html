            Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) expands upon the team-based action gameplay that it pioneered when it was launched 19 years ago.

            CS: GO features new maps, characters, weapons, and game modes, and delivers updated versions of the classic CS content (de_dust2, etc.).

            "Counter-Strike took the gaming industry by surprise when the unlikely MOD became the most played online PC action game in th   e world almost immediately after its release in August 1999," said Doug Lombardi at Valve. "For the past 12 years, it has continued to be one of the most-played games in the world, headline competitive gaming tournaments and selling over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. CS: GO promises to expand on CS' award-winning gameplay and deliver it to gamers on the PC as well as the next gen consoles and the Mac." <br> <br>

            CS:GO is the fourth installment of the Counter-Strike series and is widely considered to be the best iteration of the game till now.Even today, it has one of the largest user-bases in the world, and is constantly streamed and watched.However, CS:GO was not well received in the early days. The game was riddled with bugs, had severe lag issues, and felt like a completely detached entity of its own. Further, CS:GO did not have the same kind of speed and momentum that previous iterations did and had various features that slowed players down.

            It was then that Valve announced the Dreamhack Winter 2013 Championship, the first eSports tournament the game’s developers had sponsored. The event completely transformed the CS:GO scene and made it everything players had been hoping for since years.

            Over the next few years, the steady stream of major tournaments and increasing skill levels meant that by 2015, CS:GO has become the biggest eSports game in the world. <br> <br>
